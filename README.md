This native ionic angular application is intended to provide church goers an easy way donate to their church via their phone using Stripe's API, connected using Node.js.
<br>
This project demonstrates my ability to create intuitive JavaScript-based,front-end UI using a hybrid framework (Ionic).  I am aslo able to leverage the Angular 2 framework to design and implement application functionality.

In order to run the application, clone the repo and `cd` to the folder `church-giving-app`.  Then run the `ionic serve` in the terminal, and the application will run on your localhost!  See terminal logs for port.  For more info, see the [ionic cli documentation](https://ionicframework.com/docs/cli/).
