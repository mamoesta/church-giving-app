This native ionic angular application is intended to provide church goers an easy way donate to their church via their phone using Stripe's API, connected using Node.js.

This project demonstrates my ability to create intuitive JavaScript-based,front-end UI using a hybrid framework (Ionic).  I am aslo able to leverage the Angular 2 framework to design and implement application functionality.

In order to run the application, `cd` to the 
`ionic serve`
